        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to our website dedicated to addressing the critical issue of water pollution. As students of Lovely Professional University, Chetan and Abhinaya, we embarked on this project to raise awareness and foster understanding about the environmental challenges posed by water pollution.</p>

        <p>Passionate about creating a positive impact, our collaborative efforts aim to shed light on the various facets of water pollution and its repercussions on our ecosystems. Through extensive research and dedication, we strive to provide valuable insights, solutions, and resources to empower individuals and communities to take action.</p>

        <p>Join us on this journey as we explore the depths of water pollution issues, share informative content, and work towards a sustainable and cleaner future. Together, let's make a difference in preserving our most precious resource- water.</p>
