    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Water, often referred to as the essence of life, is a crucial natural resource necessary for sustaining and living life.
        Beyond its role in life support, water serves various essential purposes. Unfortunately, water pollution has become a global issue,
        significantly impacting our comfort and well-being. The detrimental effects of water pollution are evident, with more than 1400 people
        worldwide succumbing to its consequences daily.
    </p>

    <h2>Definition of Water Pollution</h2>
    <img class="cute" src="images/def/gama.jpg" alt="Definition of Water Pollution">
    <p>
        Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies such as rivers, oceans, lakes, and swamps. This contamination occurs when one or more
        substances accumulate in water, causing problems for plants, animals, soil, and even humans. The sources of water pollution can be categorized
        into point sources and non-point sources.
    </p>

    <h2>Types of Water</h2>
    <img class="cute" src="images/def/gl.jpg" alt="Types of Water">
    <p>
        The Earth's water is divided into two main types: surface water and groundwater. Surface water, derived from rain and snow, accounts for a
        significant portion, while groundwater results from precipitation seeping into the ground.
    </p>

    <h2>Sources of Water Pollution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Point Sources</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/ip.jpg" alt="Point Sources of Water Pollution">
            <ul>
                <li>Identified and direct sources like industrial pipes or oil spills.</li>
                <li>Examples include wastewater effluent and storm sewer discharge, affecting nearby areas.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Non-point Sources</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/ap.jpg" alt="Non-point Sources of Water Pollution">
            <ul>
                <li>Diffuse sources, often stemming from various industrial activities or agricultural runoff.</li>
                <li>Transboundary pollution, such as radioactive waste traveling through oceans, is an example of non-point source pollution.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Causes of Water Pollution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Urbanization</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/urbanization.jpg" alt="Urbanization">
            <ul>Urbanization contributes to higher phosphorus concentrations in urban catchments, impacting streams. Increased runoff, discharge from urbanized surfaces, and industrial discharges exacerbate nutrient loading in urban streams.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Industrial Wastes</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/ip.jpg" alt="Industrial Wastes">
            <ul>Industries, especially those situated along rivers, release various pollutants such as acids, alkalies, and dyes into water bodies. Chemical industries, including aluminum manufacturing, release significant amounts of fluoride.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Nutrient Enrichment</h3>
            <ul>Both natural and human-induced sources contribute to nutrient enrichment in surface water. Agricultural and urban land uses strongly correlate with nutrient concentrations in streams and rivers.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Oil Spillage</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/oil_spillage.png" alt="Oil Spillage">
            <ul>Accidental or deliberate oil discharges from cargo tankers pollute sea water extensively, forming thin layers of water-in-oil emulsion.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Sediment Disruption</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/sediment.jpg" alt="Sediment Disruption">
            <ul>Dams constructed for hydroelectric power or water reservoirs can disrupt sediment flow, adversely affecting beaches, coastal erosion, and nutrient flow into seas.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Thermal Pollution</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/thermal.jpg" alt="Thermal Pollution">
            <ul>Human activities, such as nuclear power and electric power plants, release large amounts of heat into water bodies, altering their physical, chemical, and biological characteristics.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Exploration of Oil</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/oil.jpg" alt="Exploration of Oil">
            <ul>Offshore oil exploration can lead to oil pollution in water, forming thin layers of water-in-oil emulsion.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Agro-Chemical Waste</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/agro.jpg" alt="Agro-Chemical Waste">
            <ul>Inefficient irrigation practices and subsidization in the agricultural sector contribute to agro-chemical waste, impacting water quality.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Sewage and Oxygen-Demanding Wastes</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/sewage.jpg" alt="Sewage and Oxygen-Demanding Wastes">
            <ul>Poor solid waste management leads to the disposal of organic and non-biodegradable wastes, increasing the pollutant load in surface and groundwater.</ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Organic and Inorganic Water Pollutants</h3>
            <img class="cute" src="images/def/organic_inorganic.jpg" alt="Organic and Inorganic Water Pollutants">
            <ul>Water pollution encompasses various organic and inorganic pollutants, including insecticides, herbicides, heavy metals, and chemicals from industrial effluents.</ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Water Pollution Parameters</h2>
    <p>
        Water is considered polluted when physical parameters like color, odor, turbidity, taste, temperature, and electrical conductivity exceed specified concentrations. These parameters provide visible evidence of water pollution, rendering it unfit for various uses.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Addressing water pollution is imperative to preserve this vital resource. The consequences of pollution extend beyond surface water, affecting groundwater, seas, and oceans. A comprehensive approach to curbing pollution from point and non-point sources is essential for safeguarding water quality and ensuring a sustainable future.
